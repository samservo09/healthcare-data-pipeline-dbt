# healthcare-data-pipeline-dbt
This mini-project demonstrates my knowledge of using dbt (data build tool) to build a data pipeline for analyzing patient data and improving healthcare insights.  

## The repository includes:

**Data Models**: Staging and transformation models to clean, aggregate, and analyze raw patient data. <br>
**Testing**: Implemented dbt tests to ensure data quality and integrity. <br>
**Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of data models and transformations. <br>
**Deployment**: Instructions for deploying and scheduling dbt runs in a production environment. <br>

## Why?
The goal is to showcase how dbt can be leveraged to turn raw healthcare data into actionable insights, enhancing data-driven decision-making in healthcare settings.
